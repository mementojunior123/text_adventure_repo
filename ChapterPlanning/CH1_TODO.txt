-------Now-------
-Locations aren't done (rooms 13-17)
-------Soon-------
-Think about room 12-1/19-2 (early outs), 31
-Add flavor text for high alert
------Later------
-Rename the manor to a house beacause i don't feel like describing that many places
-Add descriptitions for the basement door itself and the front door
-Tune the alert mechanic (amounts)
-Think about SFX
------Maybe------
-Think about flavor text in the case where a room is viewed on normal alert then on high alert


Notes:
-I feel like we might need to justify all the locks
-We also need to add a reason for the player to be on edge despite there being nothing
-Or maybe we can just scrap the alert mechanic completely
