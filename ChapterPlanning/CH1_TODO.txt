-------ASAP-------
-Locations apart from the living room aren't done (rooms 14-17)
-Remove placeholders (room 18-19)
-------High-------
-Think about room 13 (living room), room 2 (item stand) and room 12_001 (leaving the house without being trapped in the basement)
-Add more text for the initial entry in room 12
-Add flavor text for high alert
------Medium------
-Rename the manor to a house beacause i don't feel like describing that many places
-Add descriptitions for the basement door itself
-Tune the alert mechanic (amounts)
-----Secondary----
-Think about flavor text in the case where a room is viewed on normal alert then on high alert
