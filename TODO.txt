-------ASAP-------
-Revamp the manor search section with sub-rooms and lore
Seeing creepy events would increase paranoia
At enough paranoia you can just leave and get a good ending
Basement door is the final chance
-------High-------
-Map function
-Reminder function (ability to see logs kinda like in DDLC)
-Item drop function so I don't have to create a new management function every time there's an item drop
------Medium------
-Lore notes function
-Map editor in pygame
-----Secondary----
-Ending idea : Justified Paranoia (Lose in the basement section with enough paranoia)
